“I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not
copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign
an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will
receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any
additional offense.”

I had this done before the midnight deadline but due to the terrible internet at my house I had a tough time getting all of this from the server in order to submit it. I hope I will not have any points taken off for a few mins late. Thank you
